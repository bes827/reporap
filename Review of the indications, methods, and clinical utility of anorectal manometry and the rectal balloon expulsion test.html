Acute stress doesn&#x27;t affect rectal sensation/compliance.</li><li>Fasting unnecessary; avoid caffeine 60 min before exam (↑ anal resting/squeeze pressure, rectal sensation).</li></ul>

            <div>
                <ul><li>ARM can be performed at any time of day.</li><li>Enemas are routinely administered at some centers if stool is detected. Probe placement 30 min post-enema is ideal.</li><li>Patients should be kept informed and reassured.</li><li>ARM is generally performed in the left lateral position with knees/hips bent at 90°.</li><li>Lubricated probe is gently inserted into the rectum. Catheter should be accurately oriented for 3D-HR-ARM.</li><li>Probe should remain in situ. Voluntary contraction may ↑ anal pressure upon insertion.</li><li>Pressures equilibrate in &lt;90s; 150s is sufficient (less than IAPWG&#x27;s 3 min recommendation).</li></ul>
