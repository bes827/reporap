title: BSG/ACPGBI Guidance on Colorectal Polyp Management in Patients with Limited Life Expectancy
desc: |
  - Authors: Matthew D Rutter, et al.
  - Journal: Gut
  - Publication Date: 2025
  - DOI: 10.1136/gutjnl-2025-335047
  - Focuses on aiding clinicians and patients in decision-making regarding polypectomy versus conservative management for patients with a life expectancy under 10 years.
  children:
    - title: Background
      desc: |
        - Optimal management of colorectal polyps in patients with limited life expectancy (under 10 years) is challenging.
        - The challenge arises from balancing the uncertain natural history of polyp progression to symptomatic malignancy against the risks of polypectomy complications.
    - title: Aim
      desc: |
        - To provide guidance to clinicians and patients in considering the risks and benefits of polypectomy versus a conservative approach.
        - The goal is to aid in making informed decisions tailored to individual patient circumstances.
    - title: Methods
      desc: |
        - A guidance development group (GDG) of 28 members was established, including various specialists and patient representatives.
        - Data on life expectancy, polyp dwell time, cancer sojourn time, and polypectomy complication rates were collected from literature searches.
        - A model was created to compare the risk of symptomatic malignancy against the risk of significant complications.
    - title: Results
      desc: |
        - 33 recommendations were made within 10 domains after a modified Delphi consensus process.
        - A table was created summarizing whether polypectomy or conservative management is favored for 40 clinical scenarios based on life expectancy, polyp size, and antithrombotic medication use.
    - title: Conclusions
      desc: |
        - The guidance provides a framework for more objective and informed decision-making.
        - It facilitates the development of individualized plans between the patient and their clinician.
    - title: Introduction
      desc: |
        - Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide.
        - Most CRCs arise from polyps, but only a small proportion of polyps progress to CRC.
        - Progression from polyp inception to CRC development takes at least a decade.
        children:
          - title: Polypectomy Considerations
            desc: |
              - Endoscopists usually remove all polyps due to the inability to predict which will progress to CRC, leading to overtreatment.
              - For patients without substantial comorbidity, the risk from overtreatment is small, favoring polypectomy.
          - title: Challenges in Elderly and Comorbid Patients
            desc: |
              - Polyps are increasingly diagnosed in elderly patients and those with significant comorbidity.
              - This is due to an aging population, a lower threshold for lower GI investigation, and better polyp detection at colonoscopy.
          - title: Limited Life Expectancy Impact
            desc: |
              - In people with a life expectancy of less than a decade, the likelihood of overtreatment increases.
              - There is less time for any polyp to progress to symptomatic CRC within their lifetime.
          - title: Increased Risks
            desc: |
              - Patients with limited life expectancy have an increased risk of procedure-related complications.
              - This includes complications from endoscopic therapy and the diagnostic procedure itself.
              - Risks also arise from bowel preparation and potential cessation of antithrombotic medication.
          - title: Risk-Benefit Balance
            desc: |
              - The risk: benefit balance changes, and there may be times when there is little chance of benefit from polypectomy.
              - Sometimes the risk of harm exceeds any potential benefit, making "doing nothing" the wisest option.
          - title: Decision-Making Difficulties
            desc: |
              - It can be difficult for patients and clinicians to balance the risk of immediate harm from endoscopic procedural complications with the future risk of harm from potentially developing a symptomatic CRC if a polyp is not removed.
              - Uncertainties such as polyp dwell time, life expectancy, and polypectomy risk lead to variation in practice, perhaps most commonly favoring overtreatment (polypectomy).
          - title: Guidance Aim
            desc: |
              - This consensus guidance aims to help clinicians and patients make more informed decisions.
              - It addresses the challenges and inconsistencies in managing colorectal polyps in patients with limited life expectancy.
    - title: Methods (Detailed)
      desc: |
        - Developed in accordance with British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) guidance methodology.
        - A steering group developed the guidance development group (GDG) and drafted potential domains and questions.
        - GDG comprised gastroenterologists, colorectal surgeons, clinical (nurse) endoscopists, geriatricians, anaesthetists, general practitioners, epidemiologists, and public representatives.
        children:
          - title: Evidence and Literature Search
            desc: |
              - Literature searches were performed to provide the evidence base for the guidance.
              - A systematic review of published evidence for polyp dwell time was performed.
              - Literature searches included CRC sojourn time, life expectancy scores, and colonoscopy and polypectomy risks in elderly and comorbid populations.
              - Search terms included: colonoscopy, colorectal neoplasms, adverse effects, age, comorbidity, and life expectancy.
          - title: Assessment of Evidence and Formulation of Recommendations
            desc: |
              - The development of this guidance was in line with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).
              - Due to a lack of high-quality data, good practice statements (GPS) and expert opinion (EO) statements were developed instead of formal GRADE recommendations.
          - title: Conservative Management and Polypectomy Models
            desc: |
              - A semi-Markov state-transition model was created to simulate the clinical outcomes of comorbid or elderly patients with conservatively managed polyps of different sizes.
              - Models of 1000 patients were run for various 'clinical scenarios' of different polyp sizes (1–5mm, 6–9mm, 10–19mm, and ≥20mm) and for all Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) scores.
              - Sensitivity analyses were run for various alternative scenarios, including shorter/longer life expectancy, polyp dwell times, cancer sojourn times, and differing polypectomy risks.
          - title: Polypectomy Model Details
            desc: |
              - A separate polypectomy model was created to estimate outcomes following therapeutic intervention (i.e., polypectomy) for each clinical scenario.
              - Separate risk models were created for patients taking antithrombotic medications due to its significant impact on adverse events.
          - title: Comparative Analysis
            desc: |
              - The number of clinical cancers in the conservatively managed scenario was compared with the number of significant adverse events in the polypectomy model.
              - Recommendations were categorized as 'favors resection,' 'favors conservative management,' or 'marginal' based on the model outcomes.
              - Face validity of the model was assessed by applying it to 40 real-life examples of patients with conservatively managed polyps.
    - title: Results (Detailed)
      desc: |
        - Consensus was reached on 86 statements after three rounds of voting.
        - 53 statements were either downgraded to supporting text or merged.
        - The final document has 33 statements.
        children:
          - title: Guidance Aims, Definitions, and Exclusions
            desc: |
              - Aim: To support patients with limited life expectancy and their clinical teams in informed decision-making regarding polyp management.
              - Definition of Limited Life Expectancy: Mean life expectancy of less than 10 years.
              - Exclusions: People with transient illness or frailty, diagnosed CRC, hereditary polyposis, genetic CRC syndromes, or inflammatory bowel disease.
          - title: Factors to Consider
            desc: |
              - Patient-related considerations: estimated life expectancy, functional status, resilience to complications, patient wishes and concerns.
              - Polyp-related considerations: size, morphology, location, multiplicity, pathological type, risk of malignancy, risk of future progression, and troublesome symptoms.
              - Therapy-related considerations: therapeutic options, likelihood of success, procedure-specific complexity, and likelihood of complications.
          - title: Acceptable Options
            desc: |
              - In some scenarios, either polypectomy or conservative management may be acceptable (e.g., overtreatment where the patient comes to no harm).
              - The aim is to maximize the proportion of optimal decisions and minimize overall harm.
    - title: Diagnostic Investigation
      desc: |
        - GPS: Patients with limited life expectancy should only undergo diagnostic colorectal investigations if the outcome has the potential to benefit them.
        - GPS: In patients unfit for intervention, CT abdomen/pelvis is preferred over colonoscopy or CT colonography (CTC) to reduce harm from overdiagnosis or overtreatment of irrelevant benign polyps.
        - GPS: Prior to a diagnostic procedure, a clear threshold for therapy should be set and discussed with the patient or their representative.
        - EO: If an endoscopist needs to make a periprocedural management decision, it is generally safe to remove polyps amenable to cold snare resection.
        children:
          - title: Ethical Considerations
            desc: |
              - The principle of "first, do no harm" should be considered when planning investigation or intervention.
              - The effects of intervention on quality of life, consequences of complications, and ability to recover should be considered.
          - title: When to Avoid Investigation
            desc: |
              - Diagnostic colorectal investigation should be avoided unless the patient is experiencing troublesome symptoms requiring a diagnosis to aid management.
              - Investigation is warranted if the patient would be fit for intervention where CRC is detected.
          - title: Primary Care Information
            desc: |
              - Primary care may have additional information on how an individual has coped physically and psychologically in previous times of physiological stress.
              - This information may be helpful in decision-making.
          - title: CT Scan Considerations
            desc: |
              - In the event of a CT scan being planned for prognostication only, the purpose and limitations of the investigation should be explained.
              - The scan is to rule out significant pathology, but incidental clinically insignificant findings may be found.
          - title: Colonoscopy Consent
            desc: |
              - For patients with limited life expectancy undergoing colonoscopy, the consent process should include discussion about thresholds of therapy with reasoning based on this guidance.
          - title: Periprocedural Decisions
            desc: |
              - It is preferable to make decisions regarding the value of diagnostic investigation and the threshold for therapy prior to the procedure.
              - If this has not occurred, the endoscopist must weigh the risk of deferring therapy against the risks of a subsequent therapeutic procedure.
              - In general, it is safe to remove polyps up to 10 mm as they are amenable to cold snare resection.
    - title: Understanding Life Expectancy, Comorbidity, and Frailty
      desc: |
        - EO: Quantification of life expectancy is challenging and imprecise.
        - EO: Comorbidity indices provide a more objective assessment to aid decision-making.
        - EO: The Rockwood Clinical Frailty Scale or Electronic Frailty Index may also aid the identification of patients with limited life expectancy.
        - GPS: The CCI is most suited for estimating life expectancy in patients being considered for diagnostic colorectal investigation or therapeutic intervention.
        children:
          - title: Life Expectancy Prediction
            desc: |
              - Tools that predict life expectancy over a period of at least 10 years are required, to align with the natural history of CRC progression from premalignant polyps.
              - Life expectancy can be calculated for any age, estimating the average additional years a person can expect to live given the age they have attained.
              - Estimates depend on the characteristics of the population being studied and are an average for the cohort.
          - title: Age-Based Estimates
            desc: |
              - Age-based life expectancy estimates do not consider person-specific factors such as comorbid health conditions.
              - Average age-based life expectancy for a UK population is available from the Office of National Statistics.
              - People aged 80 years or older have a life expectancy of 10 years or fewer.
          - title: Comorbidity
            desc: |
              - With aging, chronic health conditions and diseases accumulate, often referred to as comorbidity or ‘multi-morbidity’.
              - Below the age of 65 years, it is present in approximately 30% of adults, whereas in those above the age of 65 years it is substantially higher, affecting up to 93%.
          - title: Frailty
            desc: |
              - Frailty is a multidimensional and dynamic condition characterized by declines in reserve and function across multiple physiological systems.
              - The overall prevalence of frailty is variable depending on age, clinical population, morbidity, setting, and the operational definition used for the classification.
              - It is generally accepted to be 10.7% in community-dwelling older adults, 47.4% in geriatric hospital inpatients, and 52.3% in older adults in nursing homes.
          - title: Frailty and Comorbidity Overlap
            desc: |
              - Frailty and comorbidity are distinct entities but have significant overlap.
              - There are several practical ways of assessing frailty and comorbidity, with various indices often used in community and hospital practice.
          - title: Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)
            desc: |
              - The CCI is the most validated and widely used score that stratifies life expectancy up to 10 years.
              - An age-adjusted version was subsequently developed and validated.
              - The age-adjusted CCI is used for the model.
          - title: CCI Calculators
            desc: |
              - Various online age-adjusted CCI calculators are available, including https://www.mdcalc.com/calc/3917/charlson-comorbidity-index-cci.
              - The ‘estimated 10-year survival’ provided by such online calculators is not required for the purpose of this guidance.
          - title: Early Identification
            desc: |
              - The early identification of patients with frailty and comorbidity is important, facilitated by calculation of the appropriate score.
              - Outpatient clinic review prior to requesting the procedure will usually be appropriate for patients with high CCI or frailty scores.
    - title: Understanding the Risk of Polyp Progression to Symptomatic Cancer
      desc: |
        - EO: Average annual cancer transition rate from polyps is approximately 10% for polyps ≥20mm, 3.3% for polyps 10–19mm, 1% for polyps 6–9mm, and 0.2% for polyps 1–5mm in size.
        - EO: An asymptomatic cancer takes an average of 3 years, and up to 6 years, before it causes symptoms.
        children:
          - title: Polyp Progression
            desc: |
              - Only a minority of polyps progress to CRC.
              - There is usually considerable lag time in the progression of a precancerous polyp to malignancy and CRC-related death.
              - Many elderly or comorbid individuals will be more likely to die of natural causes than from CRC.
          - title: Existing Guidelines
            desc: |
              - Several clinical guidelines relating to colorectal polyps, including colon capsule endoscopy and CTC, already include recommendations for conservative management of certain polyps.
          - title: Systematic Review Findings
            desc: |
              - The systematic review revealed a few small observational studies of polyp dwell time, along with a few modeling studies.
              - Due to study heterogeneity, statistical pooling of data was not feasible.
          - title: Polyp Natural History Model
            desc: |
              - The polyp natural history model is based on Brenner’s study (3.6 million screening colonoscopies).
              - The study provided granular annual transition rate data, including by 5-year age cohorts and both for transitions from non-advanced to advanced adenomas, and from advanced adenomas to CRC.
          - title: Transition Estimates
            desc: |
              - The granularity of these transition estimates was further enhanced by applying more detailed data on the relative proportions and malignancy rates by adenoma size from a large, English study.
              - This allowed annual CRC transition rates from various polyp sizes to be estimated.
          - title: Cancer Sojourn Time
            desc: |
              - A fixed cancer sojourn time of 3 years was used for the model, based on the Nordic-European Initiative on Colorectal Cancer (NordICC) trial.
              - The trial showed control/intervention cancer cross-over at 6 years, indicating that all asymptomatic cancers had been detected by 6 years, giving a mean sojourn time of 3 years.
    - title: Assessing Polyps and Understanding the Risk of Complications from Polypectomy
      desc: |
        - GPS: All polyps are carefully assessed for endoscopic features that the lesion might be harboring cancer.
        - GPS: The SMSA (Size, Morphology, Site, Access) scoring system is used to assess the complexity of a polypectomy.
        - GPS: The risk of overtreatment should be considered when making management decisions for a colorectal polyp.
        - GPS: Preferential use of cold snare polypectomy where appropriate.
        children:
          - title: Polyp and Patient Factors
            desc: |
              - EO: Polyp factors for complications primarily relate to the size of the polyp and caecal location.
              - EO: Patient factors for complications include advanced age, antithrombotic medication, and comorbidities such as cardiopulmonary or renal disease.
          - title: Antithrombotic Medication
            desc: |
              - GPS: The additional risk of a thromboembolic event due to cessation of antithrombotic medication should be taken into consideration when making a polyp management decision.
              - This is particularly pertinent with small polyps, where the risk of a thromboembolic event or other complication might be greater than the low risk of malignant transformation.
          - title: Estimated Complication Risk
            desc: |
              - EO: Estimated significant complication (hospitalisation) risk per 1000 elderly/comorbid patients, including colonoscopy and polypectomy-specific risk:
                - 1–5mm polypectomy: 10 (30 if on antithrombotic medication).
                - 6–9mm polypectomy: 15 (45 if on antithrombotic medication).
                - 10–19mm polypectomy: 25 (75 if on antithrombotic medication).
                - ≥20mm polypectomy: 45 (135 if on antithrombotic medication).
          - title: Consequences of Complications
            desc: |
              - EO: The consequences of complications (morbidity and mortality) can be more marked for elderly patients or patients with comorbidities, due to loss of biological reserve and failure of physiological mechanisms.
          - title: Risk Assessment Tools
            desc: |
              - GPS: The risk of surgery following an endoscopic complication can be assessed using risk prediction tools such as the ColoRectal Physiological and Operative Severity Score for the enumeration of Mortality and morbidity tool (CR-POSSUM).
          - title: Polyp Assessment
            desc: |
              - Polyps should be assessed thoroughly prior to making a management decision, using existing guidelines for assessing the risk of the presence of cancer in polyp as well as the complexities of polypectomy.
              - Care should be taken when interpreting CTC descriptions of polyps.
          - title: Colonoscopy Risks
            desc: |
              - Colonoscopy carries the risk of significant procedural adverse events including perforation and bleeding.
              - There is a risk of renal and cardiovascular compromise associated with the bowel preparation, cardiopulmonary complications associated with sedation, and thromboembolic events including major stroke.
              - Procedural risks are significantly higher for therapeutic procedures such as polypectomy and increase as the size of polyps increases.
          - title: Antithrombotic Medication Risks
            desc: |
              - Patients taking antithrombotic medication are at particularly high risk, both of postpolypectomy bleeding and of thromboembolic events on stopping the medication.
              - The postpolypectomy bleeding risk can be as high as 10% depending on polyp size, location, morphology, and resection technique.
              - Thromboembolic events such as a major stroke can be catastrophic.
          - title: Comorbidity and Frailty
            desc: |
              - All risks increase significantly with comorbid conditions and frailty and are broadly twice as common in an elderly population.
              - Even within an elderly population, increasing age and increasing levels of comorbidity and frailty further increase the risk of both colonoscopy and polypectomy.
          - title: Surgical Risk Prediction
            desc: |
              - Surgical risk prediction models such as Cr-POSSUM can help predict mortality in the event of possible complications.
              - Data from NELA (National Emergency Laparotomy Audit) and associated risk prediction tools can be helpful, but can only be used after a complication such as perforation or uncontrolled bleeding has occurred.
          - title: Cold Snare Polypectomy
            desc: |
              - Cold snare polypectomy with its lower complication rates is preferable wherever possible.
              - The complete resection rates with cold snare are comparable to other polypectomy techniques.
              - Small polyps can safely be removed without antithrombotic medication cessation (plus or minus endoscopic clipping), which should reduce the risk of thromboembolic events.
          - title: Endoscopist Training
            desc: |
              - An adequately trained endoscopist should undertake the procedure, especially in patients with limited life expectancy, where the risk and implication of complications is higher.
              - Clear postprocedure advice about complications and what to do if they occur is equally important for these patients.
          - title: Data Uncertainty
            desc: |
              - There is considerable uncertainty surrounding the risk of polypectomy in people of advanced age and with substantial comorbidity.
              - Garcia-Albeniz’s study calculated the excess 30-day risk of colonoscopy significant adverse event (hospitalisation) in a 75-year-old to 79-year-old cohort as 10.3 per 1000.
    - title: Management Recommendations
      desc: |
        - EO: This guidance is based on modeling and EO and is intended to provide an objective framework to support clinicians and patients during shared decision-making.
        - GPS: Polypectomy is only appropriate where the benefit outweighs the risk of harm.
        - EO: Where the patient is experiencing troublesome symptoms attributable to the polyp, polypectomy might be required for symptom control.
        - GPS: In the absence of symptoms, the likelihood of a polyp affecting an elderly or comorbid patient’s quality of life through progression to a symptomatic cancer during their lifetime should be considered.
        - EO: Patients should be informed that a decision to manage a polyp conservatively is reversible if circumstances change.
        children:
          - title: Model Results
            desc: |
              - The model was run multiple times for different clinical scenarios, the results of which are summarized in table 1.
              - More detailed modeling scenarios are provided in online supplemental appendix 7.
          - title: Individual Patient Preferences
            desc: |
              - While the guidance provides more objective information, individual patients might have different preferences, particularly for areas of uncertainty or where the options are fairly balanced.
          - title: Model Assumptions
            desc: |
              - The comparative model assumes parity between substantial harm from therapy (defined as patient hospitalisation) and the development of symptomatic CRC.
              - The model does not consider the timing of those harms.
          - title: Model Limitations
            desc: |
              - The guidance will not cover all scenarios but can form a basis from which individualized decisions can be made.
              - The model does not fully consider polyp multiplicity.
    - title: Follow-Up
      desc: |
        - GPS: Patients with a limited life expectancy with conservatively managed polyps usually do not require follow-up.
        - GPS: Endoscopic postpolypectomy surveillance for patients with a limited life expectancy is usually not necessary.
        - GPS: Both the patient and their referring clinician are provided with clear written information about the conservative management plan.
        children:
          - title: Conservative Management
            desc: |
              - The importance of CCI as the indicator for the selection of conservative over interventional management is that the risk–benefit equation will not improve over time.
              - It is safe practice to avoid planned follow-up.
          - title: Symptom Management
            desc: |
              - There will be instances when symptoms arise in patients whose polyps have been managed conservatively; in these circumstances, a senior decision-maker familiar with this guidance should be involved in any re-referral.
          - title: Minimizing Harm
            desc: |
              - At least some of the potential harm of colonoscopy resides in the cessation of antithrombotic medication and the use of bowel preparation medication.
              - Avoiding unnecessary future examination helps minimize this risk.
          - title: Post-Polypectomy Surveillance
            desc: |
              - For patients with limited life expectancy undergoing polypectomy, the standard follow-up with interval colonoscopy or CTC is unlikely to benefit them.
              - This decision should be individualized, involving the patient, and considering such factors as the quality of the baseline colorectal investigation.
    - title: Decision-Making Practicalities and Patient Communication
      desc: |
        - GPS: Decisions on the management of complex polyps are supported through case discussion at a dedicated polyp Multi-Discipinary Team (MDT) meeting.
        - GPS: The patient or their advocate should be involved in decision-making on the management of complex colorectal polyps.
        - GPS: Life expectancy and polyp dwell time should be discussed with patients.
        - GPS: The frequency and the consequences of complications should be considered and discussed with the patient.
        - GPS: The discussion with the patient or their advocate should happen in an environment separate from endoscopy, preferably in a clinic with the information from a polyp MDT.
        - GPS: The discussion about polyp management with the patient or patient advocate should be done by a clinician who has sufficient experience with such patients.
        children:
          - title: Realistic Medicine
            desc: |
              - Realistic medicine is about providing the care people value and acknowledging that people’s priorities may be different from healthcare providers.
              - There should be the right balance between science and the art of care, balancing evidence, professional judgement, people’s preference, and compassion.
          - title: Challenges in Decision-Making
            desc: |
              - Physicians and surgeons acknowledged difficulties of decision-making, exacerbated by uncertainties with respect to the speed of polyp progression and the estimation of patient life expectancy.
              - Tailoring decisions to the health, context, and preferences of individual patients was recognized as crucial.
          - title: Objective Discussions
            desc: |
              - Objective discussions about life expectancy can improve the consent process, helping individuals and clinicians decide whether to proceed.
              - This consensus-led, decision-making guidance facilitates such discussions.
          - title: Complex Polyp MDT
            desc: |
              - Current BSG/ACPGBI guidelines advocate discussion of all patients diagnosed with a complex colorectal polyp within a specific complex colorectal polyp MDT meeting.
              - Membership of the complex polyp MDT should include representation from operators who perform all options of therapies available.
          - title: MDT Information
            desc: |
              - The MDT should have available information on prognosis from pre-existing disease such as cancer and calculation of CCI to allow meaningful discussion.
              - With this information to hand, the MDT can shape discussions on treatment options to the individual patient.
          - title: Patient Communication
            desc: |
              - Following the MDT meeting, options should be communicated with the patient in an outpatient clinic setting.
              - These discussions are complex and should be led by a clinician who is experienced both in complex polyp management and advanced communication.
          - title: Shared Decision-Making
            desc: |
              - Sharing treatment decision-making with patients is widely accepted as fundamental to good healthcare.
              - The National Health Service constitution and General Medical Council (GMC) consent principles advocate the involvement of patients, their families, and carers.
              - Patients should be encouraged to take time to consider the options presented to them.
    - title: Training, Education, and Research Questions
      desc: |
        - Upskilling of all colonoscopists and referrers in the identification of patients who might have a limited life expectancy would be beneficial.
        - Education should be provided for endoscopists and consenters to facilitate preprocedure decision-making regarding what should/not be removed during that procedure.
        - All endoscopists would benefit from periodic attendance at polyp MDT meetings to develop greater understanding of these complex decision-making processes.
        children:
          - title: Research and Service Development Priorities
            desc: |
              - Further research is needed to better understand polyp dwell time and cancer sojourn time.
              - Further research into the risk of significant adverse events following polypectomy in elderly and comorbid patients.
              - Studies to assess the benefit of conservative management in patients with limited life expectancy.
              - Consideration of automatic calculation of the CCI from General Practice (GP) electronic data.
              - A greater understanding of public opinion on this topic.
              - Consideration that future colonoscopy polyp detection metrics exclude patients aged 80 and over, to reduce perverse incentives for overtreatment.
    - title: Guidance Review
      desc: |
        - This guidance should be considered for review between 5 and 10 years from date of publication.
    - title: Table 1: Decision Aid - Estimated Risk of Adverse Events for Polypectomy Versus Risk of Cancer
      desc: |
        - This table is a decision aid to help guide decision-making discussions between clinicians and patients. Decisions must be tailored to each individual.
        - The RAG rating provides a simple starting point to guide decision-making discussion. Red: favour conservative management; Amber: marginal; Green: favour polypectomy.
        - The inset figures are modelled estimates based on many assumptions where the evidence base is weak. They should be used with caution and should not be taken as factual, but may help frame a more detailed discussion with the patient.

        children:
          - title: Diagnostic Referral Details
            desc: |
              - Referrer: Consider comorbidity and frailty when discussing referrals with patients. Include frailty score (and CCI) if possible.
              - Endoscopy booking (admin) team: Collaborate with the clinical team to create a process for identifying patients with frailty or significant comorbidity who need to be escalated to the clinical team for review.
              - Referral letter/preassessment team: Identify patients with frailty and comorbidities; calculate frailty score and CCI if possible; refer the patient to clinic to permit further patient assessment and discussion of options.
              - Clinic consultation: Evaluate the patient and determine their frailty score and CCI. Discuss possible options, considering conservative management when suitable. If a diagnostic test is appropriate, choose the correct test for the patient and establish a management ceiling with them.
          - title: Postdiagnostic Procedure Polyp Management Details
            desc: |
              - Referrals to polyp MDT: Include CCI score with the referral.
              - Polyp MDT: Consider the CCI score from the online CCI calculator when evaluating management options (only the CCI score is needed, not the estimated 10-year % survival). Use the guidance table to inform recommendations.
              - Discussion with patient: Use the guidance table as a foundation for shared decision-making, and tailor decisions based on specific case details and patient preferences.
