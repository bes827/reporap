            <div>
                <ul><li>- The process of judging frequency by “<u>the ease with which instances come to mind</u>.”</li><li>- It substitutes a difficult question (e.g., 'What is the frequency of this event?') with an easier one ('How easily can I recall examples?').</li><li>- Involves both <b>System 1</b> (automatic impression of ease) and <b>System 2</b> (deliberate problem-solving strategy).</li></ul>
                
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Instantaneous Impression</strong></summary>
            <div>
                <ul><li>- An impression of availability can be formed almost instantly, without retrieving any specific instances.</li><li>- Example: You know that the letters <b>TAPCERHOB</b> offer more word possibilities than <b>XUZONLCJM</b> without generating any words.</li></ul>

            <summary><strong>Sources of Availability Bias</strong></summary>
            <div>
                <ul><li>- The heuristic leads to systematic errors because factors other than <u>actual frequency</u> can make retrieval easy.</li></ul>
                
        <details>
            <summary><strong><b>Salient Events</b></strong></summary>
            <div>
                <ul><li>- Events that attract your attention are more easily retrieved from memory.</li><li>- Example: You are likely to exaggerate the frequency of <q>Hollywood divorces</q> and <q>political sex scandals</q> because they receive so much media attention.</li></ul>

            <div>
                <ul><li>- Resisting availability biases is possible but tiresome, requiring effortful <u>System 2</u> engagement.</li><li>- It involves actively reconsidering impressions and intuitions.</li></ul>
                
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Example: Marital Contributions Study</strong></summary>
            <div>
                <ul><li>- In a famous study, spouses were asked to estimate their personal contribution to household chores (e.g., keeping the place tidy) in percentages.</li><li>- The self-assessed contributions consistently added up to <q><u>more than 100%</u></q>.</li></ul>
                
        <details>
            <summary><strong>Underlying Mechanism</strong></summary>
            <div>
                <ul><li>- A simple availability bias: both spouses remember their own individual efforts and contributions much more clearly than those of the other.</li><li>- This difference in availability leads to a difference in judged frequency.</li><li>- The bias is not necessarily self-serving; spouses also overestimated their contribution to <q>causing quarrels</q>.</li></ul>

            <summary><strong>Successful Debiasing</strong></summary>
            <div>
                <ul><li>- This is a rare case where personal control of bias can be successful.</li><li>- The mere observation that there is usually more than 100% credit to go around is sometimes sufficient to defuse the situation.</li></ul>
